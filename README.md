# python-challenge
In this assignment, i was tasked with building two Python scripts, one for a financial data analysis task named PyBank and another for an electoral data analysis task named PyPoll. I would say I struggled on this task alot, but the aid of online resources, Python's extensive libraries, a bit ASK BCS and some serious coffee consumption, I tried my best with it.

In the PyBank task, I counted the months, calculated the total "Profit/Losses", their changes, and extremes. 
For PyPoll, I tallied votes, listed candidates, calculated vote percentages, and found the winner. 
I've uploaded my results, scripts, and relevant files.
